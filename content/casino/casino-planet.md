Casino Planet is the official online casino of the Casino Planet gaming network, one of the most prominent publicly-traded gaming companies. It offers an impressive array of online games, including video slots, virtual table games, video pokers, and other casino games from NetEnt, Microgaming, Thunderkick, and WMS, as well as a live dealer room powered by Evolution Gaming. All of the games are available in an instant-play format, and many are available on mobile devices. Furthermore, the site offers games in over a dozen different languages. Casino Planet is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority, Swedish Gambling Authority and the UK Gambling Commission.

## Restricted Countries and Territories
Because of some strict regulations, Casino Planet is not able to offer games to players in United States, France, Italy, Spain, Hong Kong, and China among other countries. For the full list of restricted countries please see the casino details section.

## Virtual Games
Slot players have access to dozens of different titles from various software platforms at Casino Planet. These include NetEnt favorites like Jack Hammer, Microgaming titles like Immortal Romance, and WMS games like Spartacus and many more. Casino Planet is also the only place where players can find Casino Planet Classics, an exclusive series of progressive slots including Jazz of New Orleans, Cowboy Treasure, and Ring the Bells.

The virtual table game selection at Casino Planet features a number of different card and roulette games. These include multiple variants of roulette and blackjack, as well as TXS Hold'em, Oasis Poker, Casino Hold'em, Caribbean Poker, and baccarat.

Video poker players at Casino Planet can choose from four different variants: Jacks or Better, Deuces Wild, Joker Wild, and All-American Poker. All of these games can be played with up to 100 hands at a time. While this selection is varied enough for most video poker enthusiasts, there is a lack of bonus-style games.

Players looking for something completely different can try out the "Other Games" category, which features Bonus Keno, Bingo, scratch cards, and other specialties.

## Live Games
Casino Planet offers a 24/7 live gaming room powered by Evolution Gaming. Inside, players can enjoy a game of baccarat, blackjack, or roulette, dealt in real-time by a professional dealer. The games use the same rules found in most land-based casinos, and interactive features are included to make the live gaming experience as real as possible.

## Mobile Gaming
Many of the casino games in Casino Planet are available in a mobile version. These mobile games can be accessed on most modern smartphones and tablets with an HTML5-compatible browser. Players with an iPhone can download the Casino Planet app from the App Store instead.

## Support
Casino Planet understands how important customer service is, and so they have made it easy for players to get in touch with a representative. The live chat function on the Casino Planet website is available 24/7 and allows players to connect with an associate within a minute in most cases. Players can also email the casino or call them with the international phone number.

## Security and Fairness
Given that Casino Planet is this a reputable company, it is no surprise that Casino Planet uses state-of-the-art safety measures. Any time a player submits sensitive data, SSL encryption immediately obscures it. This ensures that credit card numbers, bank information, and other private details cannot be read by anyone.

The random number generator used by Casino Planet has been independently audited and shown to be fair by SKL and TST, two of the most reputable mathematical testing firms. These tests prove that players are getting a genuinely fair gaming experience at Casino Planet.
